**MooBot** is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it completely customizable. This is a *self-hosted bot*.

The default set of cogs are:
* Moderation features
* Music features

# TODO:
* Update MooBot's outputs (Talk more formally).
* Edit message with command, edit previous MooBot messages to reduce spam.

**audio.py:**
* Play .mp3 files sent to discord.
* Send link to lyrics (or fetch).
* Seek (to Time/ +10 secs).
* (local only) Send a download link for .mp3 file currently playing.
* (local only) Display Album/Anime track belongs to.
* (local only) Display title and artist.
* (local only) Display comments in metadata.
